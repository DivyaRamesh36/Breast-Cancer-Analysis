# Breast Cancer Analysis- To understand the relation between variables and to find the best model that will help to predict the status (Alive or Dead) of the new patient.

The primary objective of this project was to explore the relationships between variables and determine the most effective predictive model for forecasting the status (Alive or Dead) of new patients using available data. 
The analysis also aimed to identify key variables influencing the target outcome and assess their impact across different models. Utilizing predictive methods like CART model,Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks, 
it was determined that the CART model with accuracy of 86.02% outperformed others, emerging as the optimal choice for classifying the status of patients.
